## Bugs

Google Chrome's responsive pixel tool wasn't correctly depicting what my portfolio should look like on different screen sizes. So, to further test my website, I used [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/responsive), to double check if my portfolio displayed as it should across multiple screen sizes, and it did.

Below is a comparison of the Chrome's iPad Mini display of my portfolio, versus the Browserstack iPad Mini display.
